 This is an system-on-chip implementation for a very small processor (8 bits).
 It was design for educational purposes. Using this tool, you could explain
 the instruction cycle, how works a data path or even how to design a new
 instruction.

 For more information, read the documentation (for now is only in spansh,
 I will try traslate it).

 - Folders -

 There are two folders, one with the full implementation with IO, and a
 simplified version. These folders have the same content.

 micro:    System on chip description file for LogiSim and in Verilog
 doc:      documentation about microprocessor, tools and usage (in spanish)
 examples: Code example
 tools:    Compiler tool and micro-ops generation tool
